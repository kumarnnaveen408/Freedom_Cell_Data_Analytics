# Understanding the Market
Before entering a new market, a company must conduct a thorough analysis to understand local customer behaviors. Preferences in one country can be vastly different from another, and a one-size-fits-all strategy often fails. This project simulates this scenario for a telecom operator named "FreeCell" looking to expand. The acquired dataset contains information on telecom customers such as; Customer Profile, Service Usage, Monthly charges, preferred payment methods, churn status etc.

Based on the given data you are required to analyse the data based on the following questions and provide a summary of the user preferences and market makeup. Provide the solution to each question in a separate sheet; subparts should be answered in a single sheet.
- What is the average tenure of those customers of the telecom operator who are still with the company as a customer and also those who have stopped using the services provided by the company? churn = 'No' means that the customer is currently associated with the company and vice versa.
- What is the monthly average revenue generated by the customers who are with the company and also those who have left?
- Find the percentage of churn and non-churn customers for each category of the following services: MultipleLines, PaperlessBilling, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies.
  
Transfer the selected data into a new sheet in the same file and save it as "Customers_No Churn" for further usage.
